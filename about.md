Hello, I'm Mike. Here's a summary of what I'm about.

I am passionate about digital innovation, and I participate by strategizing, building, and scaling great digital products.

I can set executive-level visions and strategies, map out problem solving action plans, and dive in with hands-on execution.

I strive for organizational excellence by practicing **agility**, encouraging **experimentation**, and embracing a **user-centered** mindset. I believe in starting with the desired customer experience and working backwards to develop and iterate on new ideas or products.

My leadership styles are **strategic**, **democratic**, and **situational**. My core values are **empathy**, **growth**, **collaboration**, **ownership**, **pragmatism**, **resolve**, and **openness**.

Iâ€™m a technologist at heart, and I have a deep understanding of **Cloud Native**, **Big Data**, and **Machine Learning** technologies. I am excellent with **Agile** and **Scrum** methodologies, and well-versed in **Lean Product** and **Design Thinking**.


<!-- Hello hello! Welcome to my personal blog, where I write about **problem solving**, **machine learning**, **artificial intelligence**, **design** and **product management**. I'm interested in employing structured thinking to systematically tackle problems I encounter in life, work, and everything in between. This generally means 

1. Diving deep to define the root problem statement,
2. Dissecting the problem into more tractable sub-problems,
3. Prioritizing sub-problems based on impact,
4. Applying the appropriate techniques to solve the important sub-problems,
5. Establishing a suitable cadence to follow up on the solutions.

In my previous life as an academic, I contributed to research in **synchrotron-based X-ray nanoscopy techniques** and **3D object reconstruction algorithms**.
