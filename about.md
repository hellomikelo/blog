Hi there. I am a Ph.D. candidate in UCLA Department of Bioengineering, working in Miao Group in the Department of Physics on X-ray lensless computational imaging, with interest in high resolution biological and dynamic imaging. I am looking to transition into the data sciene field after completing my Ph.D. in the hopefully not-so-distant future, so through this blog I hope to build up my machine learning and data visualization skills by working on various projects. 

My main interest in the application of data science is to improve the effeciency with which our society runs.
