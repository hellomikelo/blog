<!-- I am passionate about digital innovation, and I participate by strategizing, building, and scaling great **AI-driven digital products and services**.

I can set executive-level **visions and strategies**, formulate detailed **roadmaps**, and dive in with **hands-on execution**.

I strive for organizational excellence by practicing **agility**, encouraging **experimentation**, and embracing a **user-centered** mindset. I believe in starting with the desired customer experience and working backwards to develop and iterate on new ideas or products.

My leadership styles are **strategic**, **democratic**, and **situational**. My core values are **empathy**, **growth**, **collaboration**, **ownership**, **pragmatism**, **resolve**, and **openness**.

I'm a technologist at heart, and I have a deep understanding of **Cloud Native**, **Big Data**, and **Machine Learning** technologies. I am excellent with **Agile** and **Scrum** methodologies, and well-versed in **Lean Product** and **Design Thinking**.
