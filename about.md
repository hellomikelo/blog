Hello hello! Welcome to my personal blog, where I write about **problem solving**, **machine learning**, **artificial intelligence**, **design** and **product management**. I'm interested in employing structured thinking to systematically tackle problems I encounter in life, work, and everything in between. This generally means 

1. Diving deep to define the root problem statement,
2. Dissecting the problem into more tractable sub-problems,
3. Prioritizing sub-problems based on impact,
4. Applying the appropriate techniques to solve the important sub-problems,
5. Establishing a suitable cadence to follow up on the solutions.

In my previous life as an academic, I contributed to research in **synchrotron-based X-ray nanoscopy techniques** and **3D object reconstruction algorithms**. If you are interested, then check out my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L_oHzBUAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar page</a>. 

I'm available for consulting, so if you think I can be of help to your project in any way, please [reach out to me](mailto:hellomikelo@gmail.com) and let's chat, thanks!
