After a long time of playing around with GitHub Pages and Jekyll, I've **finally** managed to get my personal blog up and running. The main purpose of this blog is to keep track of my learning progress in data science, share any findings I stumble upon as as I go through different data sets, and discuss technical problems I run into as I familiarize myself with Python, Spark, Tensorflow, etc. 

Happy learning!
