Recently I started to explore the wild wild west that is Web3. It's been moving at such an incredible speed it's really hard to keep up with all the new developments, so one way I'm organizing my thoughts around the topic is to diagram the various entities and their relationships. Hopefully these diagrams will also help newcomers to the space to get a lay of the Web3 land (or universe? Metaverse?). More to come, so stay tuned. Note that the diagram is a living document and may be updated as I learn more about the space.
