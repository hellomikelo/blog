Quick tip: If you are ever in a situation where you want to search for a keyword in every file of a directory (or even the entire computer), a very useful command line tool is `grep` ([manual](https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep)), which print lines of any file names, or any lines of text inside a file, that matches a defined pattern. Sample usage is as follows:

<!--more-->

	grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'word pattern'

where 

* `-r` or `-R` is recursive search
* `-n` is show line number of matches
* `-w` is find match for the whole word
* `-e` is the word pattern you'd like to search
