This post contains notes from my reading of [William's Style: Toward Clarity and Grace]('https://www.amazon.com/Style-Clarity-Chicago-Writing-Publishing/dp/0226899152'). 

## Clarity
Principles of Clear Writing (“tell story”)
Readers are likely to feel that they are reading prose that is dear and direct when sub­jects and verbs align with its characters and actions in a sentence.
Longer sentences doesn’t mean it’s superfluous! 
Avoid nominalization, (e.g. careless → carelessness, difficult → difficulty, elegant → elegance) 
Avoid (most) passives and agents
Active: the partners (subject) broke the equipment (object)
Passive: the agreement (subject, goal) was broken (be, past participle) by the partners (prepositional phrase, agent).
Exceptions to using passives: 
When we don’t want to state who is responsible for the action, because we don’t know or care (e.g. “those who are found guilty of murder can be executed”, “valuable records should always be kept in a fireproof place”)
You can use passives if subject is consistent in sequence of sentences 
Avoid noun + noun + noun 
If the concept or phrase is repeated throughout the writing, then keep the noun-noun modifier. If it’s only used once, modify it to a longer but easier to understand form. E.g. early childhood thought disorder misdiagnosis 
Metadiscourse 
Metadiscourse is the language we use when, in writing about some subject matter, we incidentally refer to the act and to the context of writing about it, i.e. when we write about our own writing and thinking. We use metadiscourse verbs to announce that in what follows we will explain, show, argue, claim, deny, describe, suggest, contrast, add, expand, summarize. We use metadiscourse to list the parts or steps in our presentation: first, second, third, finally; to express our logical connections: infer, support, prove, illustrate, therefore, in conclusion, how­ever, on the other hand. We hedge how certain we are by writing it seems that, perhaps, I believe, probably, etc. Though meta­ discourse does not refer to what we are primarily saying about our subject, we need some metadiscourse in everything we write.
Cohesion
Manage the flow of information – the challenge is to strike a balance between principles of local clarity and directness (mentioned above) and cohesion that fuse separate sentences together into a whole discourse.

Two principles for making sentences that tell something new (old info first, and new info last):
Put at the beginning of a sentence those ideas that you have al­ready mentioned, referred to, or implied, or concepts that you can reasonably assume your reader is already familiar with, and will readily recognize.
Put at the end of your sentence the newest, the most surprising, the most significant information: information that you want to stress – perhaps the information that you will expand on in your next sentence.

Beginning a sentence well: 
To connect a sentence to the preceding one, we use transi­tional metadiscourse, such as and, but, therefore, as a result: and therefore…
To help readers evaluate what follows, we use expressions such as fortunately, perhaps, allegedly, it is important to note, for the most part, under these circumstances, from a practical point of view, politically speaking.
To locate action in time and place: then, later, on May 23, in Europe.
Most importantly, we announce at the beginning of a sentence its topic – the concept that we intend to say something about in the rest of the sentence, i.e. psychological subjects (often times also the grammatical subjects)

Coherent topic string:
We need topics as thematic signposts to help us assemble ideas in individ­ual sentences and clauses into cohesive discourse.
The secret to a clear and readable style is in the first five or six words of every sentence. At the beginning of every sentence, lo­cate your reader in familiar territory; at the beginning of a series of sentences, create for your reader a reasonably consistent point of view, a consistent topic string.
Keep topics visible in the sentence

Passives for managing subjects and topics for flow
Passives exist to improve cohesion and emphasis; they replace long subject with short ones that focus on the context of something more familiar.

Two principles for cohesion:
Put in the subject/topic of your sentences ideas that you have already mentioned, or ideas that are so familiar to your reader that if you state them at the beginning of a sen­tence, you will not surprise anyone.
Among groups of related sentences, keep their topics con­sistent, if you can. They don't have to be identical, but they should constitute a string that your readers will take to be focused.

Designing topics:
Choose topics that will control your reader's point of view. Agent-action style composition can have different manifestations, i.e. agent’s responsibility can be assigned to different people, e.g. to the audience (the American people), to an abstraction (the desire for an independent nation), to a particular person (the king).
Emphasis 
After a clear start to a sentence with clear subjects/topics and verbs expressing crucial actions, the important new information will come at the later parts of the sentence. Just like how the opening to a sentence is named the topic, the end of a sentence is named the stress.

Managing endings:
Trim the end. Lop off final unnecessary words until we get to the information we want to stress, leaving that information in the final stressed position.
Shift less important information to the left. Move unimportant phrases away from the end of a sentence to expose what you want to emphasize.
Shift important information to the right. Moving the important information to the end of a sentence. 
Extract and isolate. When you put your most important ideas in the middle of a long sentence, the sentence will swallow them up. A way to recover the appropriate emphasis is to break the sen­tence in two, either just before or just after that important idea. Then revise the new sentences so that you guide your reader to the crucial information. That often means you have to isolate the point of a long sentence by putting it into a shorter sentence of its own.

Some syntactic devices – grammatical patterns – that add weight to the end of a sentence.
There 
→ A few grammatical patterns add weight to the end of a sentence.
→ There are a few grammatical patterns that add weight to the end of a sentence.
What
→ This country needs a monetary policy that will end the violent fluctuations in money supply, unemployment, and inflation. 
→ What this country needs is a monetary policy that will end the vio­lent fluctuations in money supply, unemployment, and inflation.
It-shift 1
→ That domestic oil prices must eventually rise to the level set by OPEC once seemed inevitable. 
→ It once seemed inevitable that domestic oil prices must eventually rise to the level set by OPEC.
It-shift 2
→ In 1933 this country experienced a depression that almost wrecked our democratic system of government. 
→ It was in 1933 that this country experienced a depression that al­most wrecked our democratic system of government.

Writing technical prose for nonexpert audience:
State explicitly information that is implied.
Introduce technical terms at the ends of their sentences. Design the sentence it appears in so that you can locate that term at the end, in its stress, never at the be­ginning, in its topic, even if you have to invent a sentence simply for the sake of defining or emphasizing that term.
Coherence I
Principles: 
A cohesive paragraph has consistent topic strings.
1) Readers need familiar information at the beginnings of sen­tences.
2) Readers will take the main characters of the story as the most consistently familiar pieces of information.
Since stories always have more than one character, and since we can make abstractions act like characters, we always have to choose our topics, to design topic strings that focus the reader's attention on a particular point of view.
A cohesive paragraph has another set of strings run­ning through it that we will call thematic strings. 
Use sequences of words that are not just repeated words, but are instead sets of conceptually related words. They will be easier to remember. 
Topic strings focus your reader's attention on what a passage is globally about, thematic strings give your reader a sense that you are focusing on a core of ideas related to those topics.
This could go wrong if 
There are too few strings, when the paragraph feels empty of meaning or repetitive without an articulated central theme.
Diffuse strings, when readers feel a passage is unfocused because no single word is used to pull together concepts. 
A cohesive paragraph introduces new topic and the­matic strings in a predictable location: at the end of the sentence(s) that introduce the paragraph.
Introduce new themes not anywhere in a sentence, but rather as close to its end as we can manage.
How we open a paragraph determines how our readers will read the rest of it, because in our opening we tell them how to frame the conceptual space that they are about to enter. To make sure they frame it in the right way, we place key thematic terms as close as we can to the end of that opening.

Paragraph = issue + discussion
Most paragraphs do not only have one topic sentence to introduce important themes and topics, but usually have 2 or 3. Readers divide units of organized dis­course – paragraphs, sections, or wholes – into two sections:
Issue: A short opening segment. Toward the end of this segment, in the stress position of the last sentence, readers look for the con­cepts the writer will discuss in the following section. Those words are often topics, but they must also include themes. Issue is analogous with subject and topic, and they put before the reader concepts or claims that the writer intends to expand on in what follows.
Discussion: A longer following segment-the rest of the paragraph. In this segment, the writer develops-and readers look for-new ideas against a background of repeated topics and themes. Discussion is analogous with verb and stress.

In short, the issue promises; the discussion delivers.


Diagnosis
If a passage does not seem to hang together, seems uncentered or out of 
focus, you may have made a promise but didn't deliver, or you may have delivered on prom­ises you didn't make. To correct that:
Look at the discussion independently of the issue and ask what themes in fact the paragraph develops. Then revise the end of the issue to include any thematic strings that are present in and important to that particular discussion.
Deliberately weave into the discussion whatever important thematic strings you framed in the issue but omitted from the discussion.
Delete from the issue whatever you don't want to develop in the discussion.
Coherence II
A coherent paragraph will usually have a single sen­tence that clearly articulates its point. 

The POINT is a sentence or two on the page that encapsulated some clear statement that we could recognize as the most important sentence in the paragraph.

A coherent paragraph will typically locate that point sentence in one of two places: (1) at the end of its issue, or (2) at the end of its discussion; i.e., at the end of the paragraph (or section or whole document).

Points in issues
Issues may consist of many sentences. However long the issue, though, readers expect POINT sentences in a pre­dictable position: in the last sentence of an issue. Sentences preceding the point:
provide transition from the previous previous para­graph, 
make a general claim that the writer will narrow in the POINT, or
make a preliminary claim that the POINT sentence re­jects

Points at the end of discussions
A writer will put her point sentence at the end of the paragraph because she intends to develop, expand, elaborate, explore that point in the following series of paragraphs.

Two generalizations about where to put POINT sentences in paragraphs: 
If the paragraph is a body paragraph, if it does not introduce a section or whole document, you can make your POINT sen­tence in either or both of two places: 
At the end of the intro­ductory issue, and
At the end of the paragraph; i.e., at the end of the discussion (POINT-last). Most readers prefer the point upfront (POINT-early), but ultimately the choice depends on the intent.

If POINT-last method must be used: 
Offer some kind of specific anticipatory POINT sentence(s) that clearly promise a main POINT still to come; and 
Include toward the end of that anticipatory POINT sentence the themes and topics that you will pursue. 

But if the paragraph introduces a section or even a whole document, then you should put your POINT sentence at the end of that paragraph.

Headings 
The words in a heading should state the new and central topics and themes of each section. To deter­mine what those topics and themes should be, simply look at the ends of your issues, at the stress of your POINTS.

Drafting
Before you begin to draft, there are a few things you might do so that you can draft productively. 
List your main characters, including any abstractions that seem to act as sources of action. Decide which characters will most interest your audience, decide whose point of view you want to take. The point of view de ned by those characters will constitute most of the topics in your topic strings. 
List a few central concepts that you think will run through your whole text. Then around each of those key concepts cre­ate clusters of additional concepts. The words for those central and subordinate concepts will provide many of your thematic strings. 
If you think you know exactly what has to go into your POINT sentence, write it out. Specifically use the characters that will constitute your major topic strings and the key concepts that will be the center of your clusters. Recall that the central concep­tual terms will go toward the end of that POINT sentence. (If you don't know your POINT go to (8).) 
Subdivide the problem into manageable segments with their particular thematic strings and characters.
Before you write the first word, decide whether the docu­ment is going to be POINT-early or POINT-last. 
If POINT-last, construct an anticipatory POINT sentence to get started. It too should have key thematic terms in it.
As you draft, occasionally remind yourself of your the­matic and topic strings. 
If you don't know your POINT, just start writing and hope. 
Once you have produced a first draft, determine whether the POINT sentence in the draft is the same as the POINT sentence you wrote before you began to draft. Look particularly for new words in the POINT in your conclusion. 
If they are different, which does the job better? It is likely that in the act of drafting you will have discovered something more interesting, more compelling, more pointed than you thought before you began.
At this stage in the process, you can begin the more de­tailed diagnostic work that goes into effective revision.
