INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT IN LINUX - PART I

export - add variables for BASH
setenv - add variables for CSH

shell = a unix interpreter

.bash_profile is the files for setting up initial environments in BASH. Persistent, i.e. everytime you log in you'll get the same environment. tcsh is the equivalent for CSH. 

/bin binary commands, libraries, directories
/tmp temporary area

diff - compares two files 

less - display file by pages
wc - word count (e.g. ls -l| wc -l --> prints number of files in a directory)
find - ...

gzip to zip the file
gzip -d to reverse file

FILTER COMMANDS
grep - ...
sort - sort files alphabetically
awk - ...
sed - ...

ls > filelist - redirect output to file
pipe (|)

BASH script
#!/bin/bash <-- comment, with full path to the shell command


C-shell script
#!/bin/csh

VERSION CONTROL WITH HG
... why not use GitHub or other version control systems? 

COMPILING AND MAKEFILE IN LINUX

steps: organic files --> compile --> link external libraries 

gcc program_name.cc (makes program_name.o file)
gcc program_name.o -L*path to library directory* -l*custom library name* (links a 3rd party library to the executable)
??? (creates an executable)

.a files contain multiple .o files. Command "ar" creates a directory of .o's

CUDA compiler = nvcc

MAKEFILE

A set of rules written specifically for make utility. Makefile keeps track of the object file vs source file. Will only compile source file that has changed. This reduces amount of commands and typing.
