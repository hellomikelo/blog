title: Potential data science project ideas

Below are some potentially interesting data science projects that may or may not already exist, but I can definitely work on once I acquired sufficient skills

#Long distance relationship booster app#

Nowadays young people are no longer bound by their home town as they go through jobs and education. At the same time, people increasingly find themselves having to maintain relationships over long distances for long periods of time. There seems to be a market for apps or services that allow couples to connect over long distances as a means to maintain their romantic relationships. This could be in the form of services that send snacks or flowers, or plays special songs for each other, or sends funny video messages. All these can be wrapped up in one centralized messaging app that allows couples to do all those things in one place. 

#Something something travel experiences#

Young people nowadays are less concerned with material things than they are with experiences, whether it is culinary experience or travel. What kind of service can be tailored to those who are interested in more visceral experiences? I really like the idea of couchsurf and MeetUp and the sense of community that build around them. AirBnB is another more mainstreamed manifestation of that concept. The sense of community as amassed via the internet seems to be big nowadays.
