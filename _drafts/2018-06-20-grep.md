If you are ever in a situation where you want to search for a keyword in every file of a directory (or even the entire computer), a very useful command line tool is `grep`. Sample usage is as follows:

	grep -rnw '/path/to/somewhere/' -e 'word pattern'

where 

* `-r` or `-R` means recursive search
* `-n` means show line number of matches
* `-w` means find match for the whole word
