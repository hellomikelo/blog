<p>No longer just a video conferencing company, Zoomâ€™s next play is in the unified communication as a service (<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/unified-communications-service-ucaas">UCaaS</a>) space, where itâ€™ll try to <strong>own the entire virtual collaboration life cycle, from pre- to in- to post-collaboration workflows, by offering an integrated and seamless communication experience, from telephony, messaging, conferencing, collaboration, to reporting and analytics.</strong> This move is evident in the recent Zoomtopia 2022 product releases and platform enhancements</p>
