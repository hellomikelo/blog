      </h2>
      The negative impact brought on by the Coronavirus pandemic is finally hitting the tech industry, as major tech companies begin laying off employees in droves in anticipation of the prolonged economic downturn. I want to understand the demographic of those in the tech industry that are impacted by this crsis, so I analyzed the profiles of AirBnB employees from their recently published AirBnB talent pool. In the post I’ll also explain the codes I used to scrape the website for your scraping pleasure.

Previously I introduced Pair, an image-based product collection recommender built using Streamlit and deployed online using Google Kubernetes Engine and Google Cloud Platforms. Recently I also deployed COV19 Tracker, an uncluttered dashboard that visualizes the latest COVID-19 case numbers across the world and in the US. In this post I will go through the step-by-step process of how I deployed those applications from start to finish. The workflow may seem long at the first glance, but it will be much faster once you go through it once. The workflow is based on this GKE tutorial on deploying a containerized web application.
