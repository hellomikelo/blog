I"6<p>I recently participated in a series of generative AI hackathons hosted by <a href="https://lablab.ai/event">LabLabi.ai</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>, and <a href="https://cohere.ai/">Cohere</a>. I built a <a href="https://hellomikelo-smarty-smarty-app-2flo6l.streamlit.app/">smart personal task planner</a>, a <a href="https://hellomikelo-openai-hackathon-app-wip-initial-r4od4p.streamlit.app/">meeting transcription and summarization service</a>, and a <a href="https://hellomikelo-semantic-search-hackathon-streamlit-app-p4qpo5.streamlit.app/">podcast search engine</a>, all using APIs provided by generative AI startups (<a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://cohere.ai/">Cohere</a>), and all done within 2 to 7 days (see project details <a href="https://hellomikelo.com/projects">here</a>). They were really fun learning experiences, and really opened my eyes to just how fast one can prototype a functional and useful minimum viable product in such a short time using todayâ€™s readily available (and often free) technologies.</p>
