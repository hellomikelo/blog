I"x<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> to build this blog for a while now, but since I haven’t been updating this blog often, I always forget the basic git workflow for pushing updated content from my local computer onto Github. Therefore, I’m writing a short guide to quickly update a Github blog when new posts are created.</p>
