I"Ž<p>During my job search, I often ask myself this question: how much time should I spend to perfect my resume versus networking and actively applying to jobs? In an ideal world with infinite time and resources (and employers who donâ€™t care about prolonged vacancies in experiences!), I could start the process only when I have the perfect resume full of completed projects and experiences, but unfortunately I live in a time- and resource-constrained world that is always forces me to have to make a choice. If I spend too much time honing my skills instead of applying, then companies wonâ€™t know that Iâ€™m open to opportunities. On the other hand, if I only apply to jobs without leveling up my skills, then my resume will not be competitive against other candidates. So what <em>is</em> the optimal way to approach this dilemma? How can I maximize my chance of landing interviews and getting a job?</p>
