<p>When the pandemic first hit us, virtual meeting was one of the few tool that connected us to family and colleagues. At that time people were happy to just have any reliable communication tool that worked. They had low expectations that were easy to satisfy.</p>

<p>But fast forward 3 years to now, after experiencing countless virtual meetings, expectations have increased, and people are no longer satisfied with the bare minimum in video communication. And thatâ€™s a good thing.</p>

<p>Truth be told, even after 3 years of practice, we still suck at hosting efficient virtual meetings. Thatâ€™s due to a combination of technological and human factors. Letâ€™s consider a typical virtual meeting journey,</p>

<p>The debate on the feasibility of remote work lingers on 3 years after the pandemic started. Companies are still bouncing back-and-forth between return to office (RTO) and remote work like an indecisive child crying and unsure whether heâ€™s hungry or just bored. The nature of work is a <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/wicked-problems#:~:text=A%20wicked%20problem%20is%20a%20social%20or%20cultural%20problem%20that's,attempts%20to%20find%20a%20solution.">wicked problem</a> because it touches upon the complex root of how humans fundamentally communicate and collaborate. As I read more and more articles about the debate in this topic, I start to question whether this is a technological or an user experience (UX) issue.</p>

<p>Solving remote work is too wide a scope to tackle in one go, so letâ€™s narrow this discussion on just redesigning the video meeting experience. Letâ€™s highlight some of the problems with current tools, then weâ€™ll reimagine what a more smooth and productive video meeting experience could be like, and how both AI and better UX can make that a reality.</p>
