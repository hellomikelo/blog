I"<p>I recently drove on freeway 101 up to San Francisco, and along the way I saw billboards after billboards filled with “AI-powered” this and that, promising unprecedented productivity boost via the power of LLMs by all kinds of SaaS companies. As someone who works in the AI/ML field, I can’t help but wonder, are we at the peak of a gen AI hype cycle? <!--end--></p>

<p>No doubt, generative models are much more capable than deep learning models of a few years past, and after letting the cat (transformers) out of the bag, the rate of innovation will only accelerate. However, I feel like there is too much emphasis on AI as the end-all and be-all solution to all problems faced by humanity. AI is a tool, just like a hammer is a tool that accomplishes a job, and we shouldn’t focus on AI as <em>the thing</em>, and rather focus on what <em>job</em> AI can help us do.</p>

<p>but I don’t think</p>

<p>I recently read an article, “<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">Know Your Customers’ ‘Jobs to Be Done’</a>”</p>
