<p><strong>Design Ah!</strong> is a design TV show produced by Japanâ€™s NHK. Itâ€™s an educational program targeted toward children to encourage them to <em>look</em>, <em>think</em>, and <em>create</em> in their everyday lives. The program is full of well-thought-out, aesthetically pleasing and minimalistic short clips that showcase various concepts in design. It is by far one of my favorite TV shows on design, because it does such a great job of exploring objects and activities we take for granted in our everyday lives and breaking them down to their fundamental units. The show really encourages the viewers to take a pause and simply observe their surroundings.</p>
