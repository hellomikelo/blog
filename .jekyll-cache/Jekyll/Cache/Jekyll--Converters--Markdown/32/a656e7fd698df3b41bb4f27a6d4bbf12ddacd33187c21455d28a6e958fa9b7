<p>The emergence of generative models with unexpected emergent behavior has captivated the world’s attention, as evident by a surge in media coverage and many tech companies suddenly becoming “AI first” companies.</p>

<p>That said, the flood of recent news in generative AI can be overwhelming, even to those who actively follow the field. The breadth and depth of the developments signify a seismic shift in the structure of the tech industry and society at large, with new personas (e.g. prompt engineers) and sectors that are spawning organically.</p>

<p>It’s worthwhile to zoom out from all the news and view the forest instead of the trees. Let’s break down this emerging “AI food chain” and analyze them conceptually by comparing them to earth’s natural ecosystem.</p>
