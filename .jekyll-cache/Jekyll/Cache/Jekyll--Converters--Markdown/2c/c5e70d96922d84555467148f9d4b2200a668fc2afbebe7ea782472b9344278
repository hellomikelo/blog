<p>Hello hello! Welcome to my personal blog, where I write about <strong>problem solving</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, <strong>design</strong> and <strong>product management</strong>. Iâ€™m interested in employing structured thinking to systematically tackle problems I encounter in life, work, and everything in between. This often means</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dive deep to define the root problem statement,</li>
  <li>Dissecting the problem into more tractable sub-problems,</li>
  <li>Prioritizing sub-problems based on impact,</li>
  <li>Applying the appropriate techniques to solve the important sub-problems,</li>
  <li>Establishing a suitable cadence to follow up on the solutions.</li>
</ol>

<p>In my previous life as an academic, I contributed to research in <strong>synchrotron radiation X-ray nanoscopy techniques</strong> and <strong>3D image reconstruction algorithms</strong>.
