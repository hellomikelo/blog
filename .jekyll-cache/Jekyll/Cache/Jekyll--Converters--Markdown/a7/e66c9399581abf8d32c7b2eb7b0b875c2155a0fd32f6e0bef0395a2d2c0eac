I"q<p>This post will explain how I created exploding text inside AutoCAD for lithography mask design using Inkscape. Normally, the text you enter in AutoCAD is automatically hatched, which for some reason cannot be read correctly by mask fracturing software. I’ve tried the text explode tool (<strong>TXTEXP</strong>) in Express Tools, but at least in the Mac version of AutoCAD it does not work. Maybe it works in the Windows version, I don’t know. Anyway, in order to properly incorporate text into your design, you must create outlined versions of your text. For this workaround I’m using AutoCAD 2017 Mac edition.</p>
