I"Ò<p>I recently drove on 101 north, and along the way I saw billboards after billboards filled with â€œAI-poweredâ€ this and that from all kinds of SaaS companies, promising unprecedented productivity boost by LLMs. I canâ€™t help but wonder, are we at the peak of the gen AI hype cycle? <!--end--></p>

<p>I recently read an article, â€œ<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">Know Your Customersâ€™ â€˜Jobs to Be Doneâ€™</a>â€</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we buy a product, we essentially â€œhireâ€ it to help us do a job. If it does the job well, we hire it again. If it does a crummy job, we â€œfireâ€ it and look for something else to solve the problem.</p>
