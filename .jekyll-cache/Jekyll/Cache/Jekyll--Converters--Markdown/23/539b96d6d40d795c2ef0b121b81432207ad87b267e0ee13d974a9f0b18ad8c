I"º<p>After a long time of playing around with GitHub Pages and Jekyll, Iâ€™ve <strong>finally</strong> managed to get my personal blog up and running. The main purpose of this blog is to keep track of my learning progress in data science, share any findings I stumble upon as as I go through different data sets, and discuss technical problems I run into as I familiarize myself with Python, Spark, Tensorflow, etc.</p>

<p>Happy learning!</p>
