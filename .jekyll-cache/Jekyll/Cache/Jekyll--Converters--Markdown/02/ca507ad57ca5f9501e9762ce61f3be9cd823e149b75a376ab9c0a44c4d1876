I"ø<p>Previously I introduced <a href="http://bit.ly/pair-app">Pair</a>, an image-based product collection recommender built using <a href="www.streamlit.io">Streamlit</a> and deployed online using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">Google Kubernetes Engine</a>. Recently I also deployed <a href="http://bit.ly/cov19-tracker">COV19 Tracker</a>, an uncluttered dashboard that visualizes the latest COVID-19 case numbers across the world and in the US. In this post I will go through the step-by-step process of how I deployed those applications from start to finish. Most of the workflow follows this GKE tutorial on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app">deploying a containerized web application</a>.</p>
