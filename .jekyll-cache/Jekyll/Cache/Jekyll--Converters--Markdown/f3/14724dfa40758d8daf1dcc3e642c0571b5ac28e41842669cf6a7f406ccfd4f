<p>Hello there,</p>

<p>This is my personal blog, where I share interesting findings in machine learning and design, as well as tips and tricks Iâ€™ve learned through troubleshooting my past projects. If youâ€™d like, you can get in touch with me via <a href="mailto:lo.yuanhung@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>, and you can see my resume at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-yhl" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> page. If you are interested in seeing my past research, please see my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L_oHzBUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar page</a>.</p>

      <div class="post-content"> The negative impact brought on by the Coronavirus pandemic is finally hitting the tech industry, as major tech companies begin laying off employees in droves in anticipation of the prolonged economic downturn. I want to understand the demographic of those in the tech industry that are impacted by this crisis, so I analyzed the profiles of AirBnB employees from their recently published AirBnB talent pool. In the post Iâ€™ll also explain the codes I used to scrape the website for your scraping pleasure.

Previously I introduced Pair, an image-based product collection recommender built using Streamlit and deployed online using Google Kubernetes Engine and Google Cloud Platforms. Recently I also deployed COV19 Tracker, an uncluttered dashboard that visualizes the latest COVID-19 case numbers across the world and in the US. In this post I will go through the step-by-step process of how I deployed those applications from start to finish. The workflow may seem long at the first glance, but it will be much faster once you go through it once. The workflow is based on this GKE tutorial on deploying a containerized web application.

I recently published a Medium blog post on a CNN-based product recommendation system I made while working at Insight Data Science. I explained how I built the recommender system using a pre-trained convolutional neural network and then deployed it as a scalable application on the internet. Check it out!

In this report I hoped to create a guide for young professionals who are interested in relocating to Los Angeles but are unsure of which neighborhood to live in. To accomplish this, I scraped data from several sources, namely

      <div class="post-content"> Recently Iâ€™ve been trying to outsource my neural network training onto a computing cluster (the Hoffman2 cluster at UCLA). Specifically, Iâ€™m trying to use Tensorflowâ€™s implementation of the CNN model on CIFAR-10 dataset. Training the model interactively was not difficult. I just had to load the Anaconda module, install Tensorflow package and its associated modules, then train the model. However, to do it non-interactively, i.e. submit as a job to a remote node, it requires writing up a simple C shell script for submission. Iâ€™m posting the command file for job submission here for those who may be interested in implementing machine learning on a computing cluster.

      <div class="post-content"> Quick tiP: If you are ever in a situation where you want to search for a keyword in every file of a directory (or even the entire computer), a very useful command line tool is grep (manual), which print lines of any file names, or any lines of text inside a file, that matches a defined pattern. Sample usage is as follows:

Here Iâ€™ll show how to quickly set up a usable Python environment using conda, assuming that Conda is already installed on your system.

      <div class="post-content"> Iâ€™ve been using Jekyll to build this blog for a while now, but since I havenâ€™t been updating this blog often, I always forget the basic git workflow for pushing updated content from my local computer onto Github. Therefore, Iâ€™m writing a short guide to quickly update a Github blog when new posts are created.

      <div class="post-content"> This post will explain how I created exploding text inside AutoCAD for lithography mask design using Inkscape. Normally, the text you enter in AutoCAD is automatically hatched, which for some reason cannot be read correctly by mask fracturing software. Iâ€™ve tried the text explode tool (TXTEXP) in Express Tools, but at least in the Mac version of AutoCAD it does not work. Maybe it works in the Windows version, I donâ€™t know. Anyway, in order to properly incorporate text into your design, you must create outlined versions of your text. For this workaround Iâ€™m using AutoCAD 2017 Mac edition.

      <div class="post-content"> After a long time of playing around with GitHub Pages and Jekyll, Iâ€™ve finally managed to get my personal blog up and running. The main purpose of this blog is to keep track of my learning progress in data science, share any findings I stumble upon as as I go through different data sets, and discuss technical problems I run into as I familiarize myself with Python, Spark, Tensorflow, etc.

Happy learning!

<!-- Hello, my name is Mike. I am currently a PhD candidate in UCLA Department of Bioengineering, working in the <a href="http://www.physics.ucla.edu/research/imaging/" target="_blank">Coherent Imaging Group</a> in the Department of Physics, under the mentorship of John Miao. My research revolves around lensless X-ray computational imaging in 2D and 3D, with applications in structural biology. The "computational" aspects come in the flavors of image reconstruction, phase retrieval and optimization. 

I was trained at the intersection of biology and physics throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies, where I sought to explain biological phenomena using physical principles. After much of my studies, I realized my passion for science is best applied to solve real world problems, in the form of sustainability, circular thinking, urbanism and smart cities. 

In the past few years I have also discovered the power of big data and machine learning and their abilities to form a deep understanding of our world. So after obtaining my PhD I aspire to transition into the tech industry and use data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence as tools to solve our urban environment problems. My interest lies in using data to understand the inefficiencies in our urban environment, and to use that knowledge to increase the overall effieincy with which our cities operate.

In this blog I hope to keep track of my learning progress in machine learning / data science and also share some of my thinkings and ideas on environmental sustainability and urbanism. If you would like to get in touch with me, you can find me through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-yhl" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, or directly through my <a href="mailto:lo.yuanhung@gmail.com" target="_blank">e-mail</a>. -->
