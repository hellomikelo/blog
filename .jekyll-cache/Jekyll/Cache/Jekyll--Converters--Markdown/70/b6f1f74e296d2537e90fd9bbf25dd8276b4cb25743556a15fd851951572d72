I"A<p>exploration is gathering information, and exploitation is using the information you have to get a known good result.</p>

<p>In computer science, the tension between exploration and exploitation takes its most concrete form in a scenario called the “multi-armed bandit problem.”</p>

<p>the problem in the most general form he could: multiple options to pursue, a different probability of reward for each option, and a certain amount of effort (or money, or time) to be allocated among them.</p>

<p>Imagine walking into a casino full of different slot machines, each one with its own odds of a payoff. The rub, of course, is that you aren’t told those odds in advance: until you start playing, you won’t have any idea which machines are the most lucrative (“loose,” as slot-machine aficionados call it) and which ones are just money sinks. Naturally, you’re interested in maximizing your total winnings. And it’s clear that this is going to involve some combination of pulling the arms on different machines to test them out (exploring), and favoring the most promising machines you’ve found (exploiting).</p>

<p>A sobering property of trying new things is that the value of exploration, of finding a new favorite, can only go down over time. The flip side is that the value of exploitation can only go up over time. So explore when you will have time to use the resulting knowledge, exploit when you’re ready to cash in. The interval makes the strategy.</p>

<p>Win-Stay, Lose-Shift algorithm: choose an arm at random, and keep pulling it as long as it keeps paying off.</p>
