<p>The introduction of generative models with unexpected <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/emergent-abilities-of-large-language-models/">emergent behavior</a> has captivated the worldâ€™s attention, as evident by a <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=generative%20ai&amp;hl=en">surge in Google search</a> and the slew of tech companies pivoting to become â€œAI firstâ€ companies.</p>

  <p>In venture capital, there are a few ways to make money. One is traditional and difficult: find and invest in promising businesses and then nurture them. Another way is to find a business, hype your investment, let its valuation balloon, and then offload it further down the line.</p>

<p>That said, the flood of recent news in generative AI can be overwhelming, even to those who actively follow the field. The breadth and depth of the developments signify a seismic shift in the structure of the tech industry and society at large, with new personas (e.g. prompt engineers) and sectors that are spawning organically.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s worth zooming out from all the news and view the forest instead of the trees. Letâ€™s break down this emerging â€œAI food chainâ€ and analyze them conceptually by comparing them to earthâ€™s natural ecosystem.</p>
