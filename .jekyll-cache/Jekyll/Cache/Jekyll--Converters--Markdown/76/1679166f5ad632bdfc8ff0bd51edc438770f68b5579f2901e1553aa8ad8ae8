<p>Hello there, Iâ€™m Mike</p>

<p>I am passionate about digital innovation, and I participate by strategizing, building, and scaling great products.</p>

<p>I can set executive-level visions and strategies, map out action plans to achieve success, and dive in with hands-on execution.</p>

<p>I strive for organizational excellence by introducing agility, encouraging experimentation, and embracing a user-centered mindset. I believe in starting with the desired customer experience and working backwards to develop new ideas or products.</p>

<p>My <strong>leadership styles</strong> are strategic, democratic, and situational. My <strong>core values</strong> are empathy, growth, collaboration, ownership, pragmatism, resolve, and openness.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a technologist at heart, and I have a deep understanding of Cloud Native, Big Data, and Machine Learning technologies. I am excellent with Agile and Scrum methodologies, and well-versed in Lean Product and Design Thinking.</p>

<!-- Hello hello! Welcome to my personal blog, where I write about **problem solving**, **machine learning**, **artificial intelligence**, **design** and **product management**. I'm interested in employing structured thinking to systematically tackle problems I encounter in life, work, and everything in between. This generally means 

1. Diving deep to define the root problem statement,
2. Dissecting the problem into more tractable sub-problems,
3. Prioritizing sub-problems based on impact,
4. Applying the appropriate techniques to solve the important sub-problems,
5. Establishing a suitable cadence to follow up on the solutions.

In my previous life as an academic, I contributed to research in **synchrotron-based X-ray nanoscopy techniques** and **3D object reconstruction algorithms**.
