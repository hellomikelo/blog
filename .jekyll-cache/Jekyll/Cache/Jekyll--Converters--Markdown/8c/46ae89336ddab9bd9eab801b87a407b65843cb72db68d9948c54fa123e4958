I"˜<p>exploration is gathering information, and exploitation is using the information you have to get a known good result.</p>

<p>In computer science, the tension between exploration and exploitation takes its most concrete form in a scenario called the ‚Äúmulti-armed bandit problem.‚Äù</p>

<p>Imagine walking into a casino full of different slot machines, each one with its own odds of a payoff. The rub, of course, is that you aren‚Äôt told those odds in advance: until you start playing, you won‚Äôt have any idea which machines are the most lucrative (‚Äúloose,‚Äù as slot-machine aficionados call it) and which ones are just money sinks. Naturally, you‚Äôre interested in maximizing your total winnings. And it‚Äôs clear that this is going to involve some combination of pulling the arms on different machines to test them out (exploring), and favoring the most promising machines you‚Äôve found (exploiting).</p>

<p>A sobering property of trying new things is that the value of exploration, of finding a new favorite, can only go down over time. The flip side is that the value of exploitation can only go up over time. So explore when you will have time to use the resulting knowledge, exploit when you‚Äôre ready to cash in. The interval makes
the strategy.</p>
