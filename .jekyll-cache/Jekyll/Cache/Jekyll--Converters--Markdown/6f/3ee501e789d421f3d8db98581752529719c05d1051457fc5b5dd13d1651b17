I"B<p>During my job search, I often ask myself this question: how much time should I allocate to perfecting my resume and honing my skills versus actively apply for jobs with my current resume? In an ideal world with infinite time and resources (and employers who donâ€™t care about prolonged vacancies in experiences!), I could start the process only when I have the perfect resume full of completed projects and experiences. But unfortunately I live in a world that is always under the constraint of time and resources that forces me to have to act as soon as possible.</p>

<p>This then leads me to wonder when I should stop refining my resume and start sending it out to companies.</p>

<p>So with those constraints in place, when <em>is</em> the best time to start the job hunt to maximize my chance of landing my optimal job?</p>
