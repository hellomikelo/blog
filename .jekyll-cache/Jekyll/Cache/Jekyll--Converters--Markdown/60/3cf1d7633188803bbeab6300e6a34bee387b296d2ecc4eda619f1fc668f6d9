I"®<p>In my experience working as a Machine Learning Engineer (MLE), I never really associated data science and machine learning with good developer experience. At least for me, when I hear ML or deep learning, I picture code-heavy projects with workflows that are mostly managed through the command prompt. At best, Jupyter notebooks and IDEs like PyCharm can help smooth out the rough edges of the development process, but the developer experience leaves much to be desired. With that mindset, I never imagined ML engineering can be carried out in an intuitive, low-code UI with drag-and-drop functionality â€“ that is, until I came across Appleâ€™s Core ML and Create ML framework.</p>
