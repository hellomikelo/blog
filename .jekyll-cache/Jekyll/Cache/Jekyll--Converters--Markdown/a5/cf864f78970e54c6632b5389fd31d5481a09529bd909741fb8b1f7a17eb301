I"È<p>I recently drove on freeway 101 up to San Francisco, and along the way I saw billboards after billboards filled with â€œAI-poweredâ€ this and that, promising unprecedented productivity boost via the power of LLMs by all kinds of SaaS companies. As someone who works in the AI/ML field, I canâ€™t help but wonder, <strong>are we at the peak of a gen AI hype cycle?</strong> <!--end--></p>

<p>To be clear, I agree that generative models are much more capable than their older deep learning cousins, and with the cat (transformers) out of the bag, the rate of innovation in the field will only accelerate. However, I feel like there is too much emphasis on AI as the end-all and be-all solution to all problems faced by everyone. AI is a tool, just like a hammer is a tool that accomplishes a job, and we shouldnâ€™t focus on AI as <em>the thing</em>, and rather focus on what <em>job</em> AI can help us do.</p>

<p>The HBR article, â€œ<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">Know Your Customersâ€™ â€˜Jobs to Be Doneâ€™</a>â€, has a quote thatâ€™s relevant to my point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we buy a product, we essentially â€œhireâ€ it to help us do a job. If it does the job well, we hire it again. If it does a crummy job, we â€œfireâ€ it and look for something else to solve the problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some reason, many companies think having gen AI alone will be a major differentiator and revenue booster, as if people hear AI and their problems are miraculously solved.</p>

<p>â€œJobâ€ is shorthand for what an individual really seeks to accomplish in a given circumstance.</p>

<p>The circumstances are more important than customer characteristics, product attributes, new technologies, or trends.</p>

<p>Good innovations solve problems that formerly had only inadequate solutionsâ€”or no solution.</p>

<p>Jobs are multifaceted. Theyâ€™re never simply about function; they have powerful social and emotional dimensions.</p>
