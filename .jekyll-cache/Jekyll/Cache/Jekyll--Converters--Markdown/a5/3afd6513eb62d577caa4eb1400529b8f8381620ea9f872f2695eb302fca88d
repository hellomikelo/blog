I"Y<p>This weekend I drove up the peninsula via 101 north, and the billboards I saw along the way were filled with “AI-powered” this and that from all kinds of SaaS companies.</p>

<p>I recently read an article, “<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">Know Your Customers’ ‘Jobs to Be Done’</a>”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we buy a product, we essentially “hire” it to help us do a job. If it does the job well, we hire it again. If it does a crummy job, we “fire” it and look for something else to solve the problem.</p>
