I"T<p>A question that I often ask myself during this job hunting process is this: how early before I need a job should I start applying for jobs so I have the best chance of landing not just <em>any</em> job, but my optimal job? This then leads me to wonder when I should stop refining my resume and start sending it out to companies. In an ideal world with infinite time and resources (and employers who donâ€™t care about prolonged vacancies in experiences), I would only start the process when I have the perfect resume full of completed projects and experiences. But unfortunately I live in a world that is always under the constraint of time and resources that forces me to have to act as soon as possible. So with those constraints in place, when <em>is</em> the best time to start the job hunt to maximize my chance of landing my optimal job?</p>
