<p>When the pandemic first hit us, virtual meeting was one of the few tool that connected us to family and colleagues. At that time people were happy to just have any reliable communication tool that worked – they had low expectations and were easy to satisfy.</p>

<p>But fast forward 3 years to now, after countless virtual meetings, expectations have increased. Companies and workers are no longer satisfied with the bare minimum in video communication, because they are tired of having inefficient meetings that waste their time and don’t produce good output. And that’s a good thing.</p>

<p>Truth be told, even after 3 years of practice, most people still suck at having productive virtual meetings. This is due to a combination of technological and human factors.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a typical virtual meeting journey,</p>

<p><em>&lt;placeholder&gt;</em></p>

<p>Here are some possible ways that can inject pain into the overall experience.</p>

      <td>Realize the discussion is irrelevant to you</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Discuss</td>
      <td>Meeting drags on and wanders aimlessly with no notes taken</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>End meeting</td>
      <td>No concrete action items and summary to take away</td>
    </tr>

<p>What’s worse, the following week you may get another meeting invite on the same topic. This is a nightmarish meetings deja vu!</p>

<p>Improvements to existing solutions should be a combination of technological (e.g. AI) and user experience (UX) issue.</p>

<p>Honestly, virtual communication is not an easy problem to solve, and it requires</p>

<!-- The debate on the feasibility of remote work lingers on 3 years after the pandemic started. Companies are still bouncing back-and-forth between return to office (RTO) and remote work like an indecisive child crying and unsure whether he's hungry or just bored. The nature of work is a [wicked problem](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/wicked-problems#:~:text=A%20wicked%20problem%20is%20a%20social%20or%20cultural%20problem%20that's,attempts%20to%20find%20a%20solution.) because it touches upon the complex root of how humans fundamentally communicate and collaborate. As I read more and more articles about the debate in this topic, I start to question whether this is a technological or an user experience (UX) issue.

Solving remote work is too wide a scope to tackle in one go, so let's narrow this discussion on just redesigning the video meeting experience. Let's highlight some of the problems with current tools, then we'll reimagine what a more smooth and productive video meeting experience could be like, and how both AI and better UX can make that a reality.
