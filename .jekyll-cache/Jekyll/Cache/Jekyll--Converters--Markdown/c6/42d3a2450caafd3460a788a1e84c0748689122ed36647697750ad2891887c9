<p>When the pandemic first hit, virtual meeting was one of the few tools that truly connected us to family and colleagues. At that time people were happy to have just any reliable communication tool that worked â€“ they had low expectations and were easy to satisfy.</p>

<p>But fast forward 3 years to now, expectations have changed. After countless virtual meetings, companies and workers are no longer satisfied with the bare minimum in video communication. They are tired of having inefficient meetings that suck disproportionate of their time but produce a fraction of the value. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/workers-say-its-harder-to-get-things-done-now-heres-why-2a5f1389">Workers Now Spend Two Full Days a Week on Email and in Meetings</a>.</p>

<p>This frustration is a <em>good</em> thing.</p>

<p>Truth be told, even after 3 years of practice, most people still suck at having productive virtual meetings. This is due to a combination of technological and human factors.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s consider a typical virtual meeting journey,</p>

<p><em>&lt;placeholder&gt;</em></p>

<p>Here are some possible pain points that can sting the overall experience.</p>

    <tr>
      <th>Journey</th>
      <th>Pain</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Receive meeting invite</td>
      <td>No meeting agenda or any context</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Join meeting</td>
      <td>Realize the discussion is irrelevant to you</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Discuss</td>
      <td>Meeting drags on and wanders aimlessly with no notes taken</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>End meeting</td>
      <td>No concrete action items and summary to take away</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>Whatâ€™s worse, the following week you may get <em>another</em> meeting invite on the same topic. This is a meetings deja vu!</p>

<h2 id="redesigning-the-meeting-experience">Redesigning the Meeting Experience</h2>

<p>So how might we redesign virtual meetings for a happier experience? Improvements to existing solutions require a system-level approach that involve a combination of technological (e.g. AI) and user experience innovations (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">nudges</a>).</p>
