<p>I recently published a <a href="https://blog.insightdatascience.com/building-a-scalable-online-product-recommender-with-keras-docker-gcp-and-gke-52a5ab2c7688" title="post">Medium blog post</a> on a CNN-based product recommendation system I made while working at Insight Data Science. I explained how I built the recommender system using a pre-trained convolutional neural network and then deployed it as a scalable application on the internet. Check it out!</p>
