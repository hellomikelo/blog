<p>Traditionally image denoising in electron and X-ray microscopy relies on subtracting a background that is either a constant throughout the image, or by mathematically estimating a smooth background using methods such as the Laplaceâ€™s equation. Such methods are either too crude, or required segmenting the object and creating a mask in order to form the boundary for estimation, and also oftentimes requires manually-chosen tuning parameters for optimal performance.</p>
