<!-- Hello, my name is Mike. I am currently a PhD candidate in UCLA Department of Bioengineering, working in the <a href="http://www.physics.ucla.edu/research/imaging/" target="_blank">Coherent Imaging Group</a> in the Department of Physics, under the mentorship of John Miao. My research revolves around lensless X-ray computational imaging in 2D and 3D, with applications in structural biology. The "computational" aspects come in the flavors of image reconstruction, phase retrieval and optimization. 

I was trained at the intersection of biology and physics throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies, where I sought to explain biological phenomena using physical principles. After much of my studies, I realized my passion for science is best applied to solve real world problems, in the form of sustainability, circular thinking, urbanism and smart cities. 

In the past few years I have also discovered the power of big data and machine learning and their abilities to form a deep understanding of our world. So after obtaining my PhD I aspire to transition into the tech industry and use data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence as tools to solve our urban environment problems. My interest lies in using data to understand the inefficiencies in our urban environment, and to use that knowledge to increase the overall effieincy with which our cities operate.

In this blog I hope to keep track of my learning progress in machine learning / data science and also share some of my thinkings and ideas on environmental sustainability and urbanism. If you would like to get in touch with me, you can find me through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-yhl" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, or directly through my <a href="mailto:lo.yuanhung@gmail.com" target="_blank">e-mail</a>. -->
