<p>The introduction of generative models with unexpected <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/emergent-abilities-of-large-language-models/">emergent behavior</a> has captivated the world‚Äôs attention, as evident by a <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=generative%20ai&amp;hl=en">surge in Google search</a> and the slew of tech companies pivoting to become ‚ÄúAI first‚Äù companies.</p>

<p>That said, the flood of recent news in generative AI can be overwhelming, even to those who actively follow the field. The breadth and depth of the developments signify a seismic shift in the structure of the tech industry and society at large, with new personas (e.g. prompt engineers) and sectors that are spawning organically.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs worth zooming out from all the news and view the forest instead of the trees. Let‚Äôs break down this emerging ‚ÄúAI food chain‚Äù and analyze them conceptually by comparing them to earth‚Äôs natural ecosystem.<!--end--></p>

<p>Digging deeper, lets expand upon that analogy and describe the key players in each group of the food chain.</p>

<p>Just as in a natural ecosystem, the AI ecosystem is driven by a complex web of interactions between producers, consumers, and decomposers. By contextualizing the players in generative AI into this ‚ÄúAI food chain,‚Äù we can begin to navigate this sea of recent developments and understand where each new technology or company fits into the overall ecosystem.</p>

<p>And just like the natural food web, the interrelationships within the AI food web can be so intricate that a disruption to one component can cause a domino effect through the rest. While it‚Äôs not immediately obvious how actionable this kind of systems thinking can be, I do think we can map the rules and behaviors of the natural ecosystem to the AI ecosystem, and by embracing this analogous approach, we can better understand how new entrants into the ecosystem could affect the incumbents.</p>
