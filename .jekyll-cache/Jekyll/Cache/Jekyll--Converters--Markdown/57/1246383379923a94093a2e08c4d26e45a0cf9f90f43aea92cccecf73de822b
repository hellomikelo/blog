<p>Traditionally image denoising in electron and X-ray microscopy rely</p>

<p>background is estimated by either subtracting a constant value from the entire image,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Or by creating a mask of the object of interest and use Laplaceâ€™s equation to estimate and subtract background.</li>
  <li>Such methods are either too crude, or required segmenting the object and creating a mask in order to form the boundary for estimation, and also oftentimes requires manually-chosen tuning parameters for optimal performance.</li>
</ul>
