      Zoomâ€™s push to build a unified communication platform

No longer just a video conferencing company, Zoomâ€™s next play is in the unified communication as a service (UCaaS) space, where itâ€™ll try to own the entire virtual collaboration life cycle, from pre- to in- to post-collaboration workflows, by offering an integrated and seamless communication experience, from telephony, messaging, conferencing, collaboration, to reporting and analytics. This move is evident in the recent Zoomtopia 2022 product releases and platform enhancements.

      In my experience working as a Machine Learning Engineer, I never really associated data science and machine learning with good developer experience. At least for me, when I hear ML or deep learning, I picture code-heavy projects with workflows that are mostly managed through the command prompt. At best, Jupyter notebooks and IDEs like PyCharm can help smooth out the rough edges of the development process, but the developer experience leaves much to be desired. With that mindset, I never imagined ML engineering can be carried out in an intuitive, low-code UI with drag-and-drop functionality â€“ that is, until I came across Appleâ€™s Core ML and Create ML framework.

      Just wrapped up my first ever Databricks Data+AI Summit last week in SF. It was great to connect with colleagues and nerd out about machine learning (ML) and ML operations (MLOps). I learned a whole lot about the maturation of scalable ML across various industries (tech, communication, media, entertainment), and also got a feel for where the sector is heading in the next 2-3 years. Here are some major takeaways and interesting ideas I gathered from the summit.

      </h2>
      <span class="post-meta">Jun 5, 2022</span>
      When faced with an open-ended and complex problem with no clear solution in sight, whatâ€™s the best way to tackle it? In the past, Iâ€™d usually start by panicking, overwhelmed, and generally being clueless about where and how to start. But over time, from experience and from reading about various problem solving frameworks, I started to form a mental model for approaching these complicated problems. The more I practice, the more I see that mental model being applicable in different situations.

      Recently I started to explore the wild wild west that is Web3. Itâ€™s been moving at such an incredible speed itâ€™s really hard to keep up with all the new developments, so one way Iâ€™m organizing my thoughts around the topic is to diagram the various entities and their relationships. Hopefully these diagrams will also help newcomers to the space to get a lay of the Web3 land (or universe? Metaverse?). More to come, so stay tuned. Note that the diagram is a living document and may be updated as I learn more about the space.
