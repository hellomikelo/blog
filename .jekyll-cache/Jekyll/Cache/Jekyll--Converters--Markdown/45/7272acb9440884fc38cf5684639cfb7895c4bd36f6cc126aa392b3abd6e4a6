<p>In the classic 1999 open world arcade racing game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Taxi">Crazy Taxis</a> (see sample <a href="https://youtu.be/qjIGkv0_dEM?t=164">gameplay</a> here), the player assumes the role of a taxi driver who must accumulate money by delivering passengers to their destinations in the fastest time possible, earning tips by performing “crazy stunts” such as drifts, jumps, and near-misses before the passenger countdown and the main clock time run out. Ah… the nostalgia. It was a fun and engaging game. What if we can take Crazy Taxi’s core concepts and apply them in real life to achieve our problem-solving goals with the same enthusiasm?</p>
