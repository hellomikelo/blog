I"ü<p>When faced with an open-ended and complex problem with no clear solution in sight, whatâ€™s the best way to tackle it? In the past, Iâ€™d usually start by panicking, overwhelmed, and generally being clueless about where and how to start. But over time, from experience and from reading about various problem solving frameworks, I started to form a mental model for approaching these complicated problems. The more I practice, the more I see that mental model being applicable in different situations.</p>
