I"<p>I recently drove on freeway 101 up to San Francisco, and along the way I saw billboards after billboards filled with “AI-powered” this and that, promising unprecedented productivity boost via the power of LLMs by all kinds of SaaS companies. As someone who works in the AI/ML field, I can’t help but wonder, are we at the peak of a gen AI hype cycle? <!--end--></p>

<p>I recently read an article, “<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done">Know Your Customers’ ‘Jobs to Be Done’</a>”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we buy a product, we essentially “hire” it to help us do a job. If it does the job well, we hire it again. If it does a crummy job, we “fire” it and look for something else to solve the problem.</p>
