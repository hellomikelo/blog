<p>With close to 4 million people, Los Angeles is a cultural hodgepodge that is made up of more diverse cultures and neighborhoods than what Hollywood portrays on TV. Newcomers in LA will most likely have questions about which neighborhoods are affordable and safe to live in, and which ones are fun for a night out. To answer those questions, through this data-driven guide I hoped to inform young professionals who are interested in relocating to Los Angeles but are unsure of which neighborhood to live in.</p>
