I"Ü<p>Previously I introduced <a href="http://bit.ly/pair-app">Pair</a>, an image-based product collection recommender built using <a href="www.streamlit.io">Streamlit</a> and deployed online using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">Google Kubernetes Engine</a>. Recently I also deployed <a href="http://bit.ly/cov19-tracker">COV19 Tracker</a>, an uncluttered dashboard that visualizes the latest COVID-19 case numbers across the world and in the US. In this post I will go through the step-by-step process of how I deployed those applications. Most of the workflow follows this GKE tutorial on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/hello-app">deploying a containerized web application</a>.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before starting, you should <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install">install the Cloud SDK</a>, which includes the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gcloud</code> command-line tool that provides the primary command-line interface for Google Cloud. After installing Cloud SDK, you should install the <code class="highlighter-rouge">kubectl</code> command-line tool, which provides the primary command-line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters. <code class="highlighter-rouge">kubectl</code> can be installed by running the following command:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">gcloud components install kubectl</code></p>
</blockquote>
