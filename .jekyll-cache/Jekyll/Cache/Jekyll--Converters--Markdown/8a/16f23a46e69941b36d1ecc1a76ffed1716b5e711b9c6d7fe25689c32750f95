I"ó<p>Iâ€™ve been using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> to build this blog for a while now, but since I havenâ€™t been updating this blog often, I always forget the basic git workflow for pushing updated content from my local computer onto Github. Therefore, Iâ€™m writing a short guide to quickly update a Github blog when new posts are created.</p>

<h2 id="update-blog-from-user-computer-to-github">Update blog from user computer to Github</h2>

<p>Note: instructions here assumes you have already set up a Github blog, using static site generators such as <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. For instructions on how to do that I refer to Githubâ€™s tutorial on <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/" target="_blank"> Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming youâ€™ve just finished creating a post on your local computer and you are ready to push the content onto Github. Navigate to your blog directory (i.e. directory that contains <code class="highlighter-rouge">.git/</code>) in command line, and do the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add .
git commit -m "descriptive-message-of-changes-to-be-committed"
git push
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will <code class="highlighter-rouge">add</code> all files in the directory to the staging area, then <code class="highlighter-rouge">commit</code> them to be submitted to Github. You will be required to include a message with the changes (this is a good practice anyway). At this step the changes youâ€™ve made still only exist on the local computer. By running<code class="highlighter-rouge">push</code> you will send the updated files to Github and finish the update process.</p>

<p>So thatâ€™s it! Happy blogging!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To see if any other files are not updated between branches, you can check the status of file-keeping with</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  git status
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can also preview the blog on your local computer by</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  jekyll serve
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>The prompt will show you a server address, (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:4444) that you can then open with in a browser to see a preview of your blog.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes if you mess with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file that contains Jekyllâ€™s configuration parameters, you may introduce errors that will prevent Github from updating any changes. YAML files are very sensitive to formatting, so sometimes even missing a white space can ruin things. To check for errors, you can use the <a href="https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator" target="_blank">YAML validator</a> from Code Beautify.</p>
