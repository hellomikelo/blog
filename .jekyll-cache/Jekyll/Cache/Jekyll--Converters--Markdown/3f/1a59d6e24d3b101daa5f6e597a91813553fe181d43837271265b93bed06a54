I"M<p>During my job search, I often ask myself this question: how much time should I allocate to perfecting my resume and honing my skills versus actively apply for jobs with my current resume? In an ideal world with infinite time and resources (and employers who don’t care about prolonged vacancies in experiences!), I could start the process only when I have the perfect resume full of completed projects and experiences, but unfortunately I live in a time- and resource-constrained world that is always forces me to have to make a choice. If I spend too much time honing my skills, then I won’t have a chance to let companies know that I’m open to opportunities. On the other hand, if I spend too much time applying for jobs, then my resume may not be competitive against other candidates. So what is the right mindset to approach this job search dilemma? Put another way, how can I maximize my chance of landing interviews and getting a job?</p>

<p>So with those constraints in place, when <em>is</em> the best time to start the job hunt to maximize my chance of landing my optimal job?</p>
