<p>Hello there,</p>

<p>This is my personal blog, where I share interesting findings in machine learning and design, as well as tips and tricks I’ve learned through troubleshooting my past projects. If you’d like, you can get in touch with me via <a href="mailto:lo.yuanhung@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>, and you can see my resume at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-yhl" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> page. If you are interested in seeing my past research, please see my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L_oHzBUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar page</a>.</p>

      <!-- <div class='post-content'> The negative impact brought on by the Coronavirus pandemic is finally hitting the tech industry, as major tech companies begin laying off employees in droves in anticipation of the prolonged economic downturn. I want to understand the demographic of those in the tech industry that are impacted by this crisis, so I analyzed the profiles of AirBnB employees from their recently published AirBnB talent pool. In the post I’ll also explain the codes I used to scrape the website for your scraping pleasure.

Previously I introduced Pair, an image-based product collection recommender built using Streamlit and deployed online using Google Kubernetes Engine and Google Cloud Platforms. Recently I also deployed COV19 Tracker, an uncluttered dashboard that visualizes the latest COVID-19 case numbers across the world and in the US. In this post I will go through the step-by-step process of how I deployed those applications from start to finish. The workflow may seem long at the first glance, but it will be much faster once you go through it once. The workflow is based on this GKE tutorial on deploying a containerized web application.

<!-- Hello, my name is Mike. I am currently a PhD candidate in UCLA Department of Bioengineering, working in the <a href="http://www.physics.ucla.edu/research/imaging/" target="_blank">Coherent Imaging Group</a> in the Department of Physics, under the mentorship of John Miao. My research revolves around lensless X-ray computational imaging in 2D and 3D, with applications in structural biology. The "computational" aspects come in the flavors of image reconstruction, phase retrieval and optimization. 

I was trained at the intersection of biology and physics throughout my undergraduate and graduate studies, where I sought to explain biological phenomena using physical principles. After much of my studies, I realized my passion for science is best applied to solve real world problems, in the form of sustainability, circular thinking, urbanism and smart cities. 

In the past few years I have also discovered the power of big data and machine learning and their abilities to form a deep understanding of our world. So after obtaining my PhD I aspire to transition into the tech industry and use data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence as tools to solve our urban environment problems. My interest lies in using data to understand the inefficiencies in our urban environment, and to use that knowledge to increase the overall effieincy with which our cities operate.

In this blog I hope to keep track of my learning progress in machine learning / data science and also share some of my thinkings and ideas on environmental sustainability and urbanism. If you would like to get in touch with me, you can find me through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-yhl" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, or directly through my <a href="mailto:lo.yuanhung@gmail.com" target="_blank">e-mail</a>. -->
