<p>The emergence of generative models with unexpected emergent behavior has captivated the world’s attention, as evident by a surge in media coverage and many tech companies suddenly becoming “AI first” companies.</p>

<p>That said, the flood of recent news in generative AI can be overwhelming, even to those who actively follow the field. The breadth and depth of the developments signify a seismic shift in the structure of the tech industry and society at large, with new personas (e.g. prompt engineers) and sectors that are spawning organically.</p>

<p>It’s worthwhile to zoom out from all the news and view the forest instead of the trees. Let’s break down this emerging “AI food chain” and analyze them conceptually by comparing them to earth’s natural ecosystem.<!--end--></p>

      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>Secondary Consumers</strong></td>
      <td>Omnivores and carnivores like snakes and Komodo dragons that consume the outputs of primary consumers as their daily diet.</td>

      <td style="text-align: center"><strong>Decomposers</strong></td>
      <td>Fungi and bacteria that play a crucial role in breaking down organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, which sustains the producers.</td>
      <td><strong>Bots</strong> and <strong>data scrapers</strong> that collect publicly available data byproducts generated by upstream consumers and producers, then transform it into nutrient-rich datasets that can in turn be used by producers to enhance the large models.</td>

<p>Just as in a natural ecosystem, the AI ecosystem is driven by a complex web of interactions between producers, consumers, and decomposers.</p>

<p>By contextualizing the recent developments in AI into this “model food chain,” we can begin to navigate this sea of development and understand where each piece fits into the overall puzzle. Looking forward, this kind of holistic systems thinking can enable us to imagine how perturbations could disrupt the stability of the overall ecosystem. The interrelationships within a food web can be so intricate that a chain of disruptive events can occur when one ecosystem component changes, causing a domino effect.</p>
