I"_<p>I attended a Software Carpentry workshop that teaches basic research computing skills. The following useful reference materials are taken from their GitHub pages on [shell scripting]](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/reference/), <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/reference/">Python</a>, and <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/reference">git</a>. These are really useful so I highly recommend using them for basic reference. Advanced version is <a href="https://intermediate-and-advanced-software-carpentry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">here</a></p>
